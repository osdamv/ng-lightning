This library contains native [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) components and directives written from scratch in TypeScript using the [Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/) CSS framework.

**This release is a developer preview.** We are looking for community help to find and fix bugs, improve demo site and create new components.

## Installation

Install through `npm`:

```bash
npm install --save ng-lightning
```

If you use **SystemJS** to load your files, you may want to use our bundle file through [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/)

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/ng-lightning@x.x.x/ng-lightning.bundle.js"></script>
```

It is also needed include the styles of Salesforce Lightning Design System, by npm 

```bash 
npm install @salesforce-ux/design-system --save
```

#### IE11 support
Unfortunately, IE11 does not support two important features.

* [SVG External Content](https://css-tricks.com/svg-use-with-external-reference-take-2/), used to load SVG icons from a spritemap. In order to support this, you will need to use a small script called [svg4everybody](https://github.com/jonathantneal/svg4everybody).  
Available on npm cdn [here](https://unpkg.com/svg4everybody).

* `Element.classList` on SVG elements, used by Angular's `renderer.setElementClass`. See [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/6327) for more information. Use [classList.js](https://github.com/eligrey/classList.js) shim, available on npm cdn [here](https://unpkg.com/classlist.js).

Typically, these shims should be placed within the `<head>` element.  

**Note**: To prevent considerable rendering load in IE11, utilize `core-js` over `es6-shim`. See the [Angular 2 documentation](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/npm-packages.html) for more information.
